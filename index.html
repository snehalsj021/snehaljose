			Hi, I am <b>Snehal Jose</b>.
			<br><br>
			I was born in India, and I'm currently working at Infosys as a System Engineer on -----. Recently, I graduated from APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, where I studied Computer Science and Engineering. I have a passion for all things creative also coding, and I'm always looking to create meaningful experiences and memorable stories. 
			<br><br>
			Since I developed this webpage as a not that small as to keep it simple, my interests in Computer Science have expanded to web development, user interface design and mobile app development. I've worked on some cool projects, including <a href="https://density.adicu.com/" target="_blank">an app that help the people to track each and every bus</a>, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/selfie-activism" target="_blank">an decive which help to switch off the light and other electronic devices if there are no people in the room.</a>
			<br><br>
			When I'm not thinking in code or pixels, I love playing football and cricket, getting involved with learning new skills, taking photos of my sweet moments,  and  spending time with my friends.
